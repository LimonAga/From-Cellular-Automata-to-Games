# Cellular Automata to Games

## ⚠️ Work In Progress
This repository is currently under development. Projects, categories, and structure may change over time.

## 🎯 About This Project
This is a compilation of various projects I’ve created over the years but never uploaded to GitHub. The projects range in complexity and are grouped into three categories:

- **Beginner** – Projects that typically take 30 minutes to an hour complete.
- **Intermediate** – Projects that take several hours to complete.  
- **Advanced** – Projects that can take multiple days to complete, including larger games or more algorithmically intensive programs.  

The goal of this repository is to showcase projects from simple cellular automata to complex games, with clear explanations and beginner-friendly code.

## 📂 Project Structure (Planned)
- `/beginner/` – Simple projects and small cellular automata
- `/intermediate/` – More complex automata, puzzles, and mini-games 
- `/advanced/` – Larger games like Chess, Checkers, Minesweeper, and algorithm-heavy projects

## 📌 Notes
- Each project will include a README with instructions and examples.
