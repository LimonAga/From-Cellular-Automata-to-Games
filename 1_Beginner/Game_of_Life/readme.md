# Game of Life üéÆ

**Conway‚Äôs Game of Life** is a *cellular automaton* originally devised by mathematician **John Conway**.  
A cellular automaton is a grid of cells that evolve over time according to simple rules.  
Each cell can be in a finite number of states ‚Äî most often ‚Äúalive‚Äù or ‚Äúdead‚Äù ‚Äî and the state of each cell in the next generation depends on the states of its neighbors.

The Game of Life is one of the simplest and most famous examples. It follows just two elegant rules:

1. A live cell with **2 or 3 neighbors** survives to the next generation.  
2. A dead cell with **exactly 3 neighbors** becomes alive.

From these two simple rules, surprisingly complex and beautiful patterns emerge ‚Äî gliders, blinkers, still lifes, and more.  
This project includes **two versions**:  
- A **terminal version** requiring no external modules.  
- A **Pygame version** running in fullscreen.



## Why Cellular Automata?

Cellular automata are fascinating because they show how **complex behavior** can emerge from **simple rules**.  
They‚Äôre lightweight to simulate, easy to code, and can produce mesmerizing, organic visuals ‚Äî perfect for experimentation and exploration.
